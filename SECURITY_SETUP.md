# Security Configuration Guide for TeamA.Todo Application

This guide explains how to properly configure the security settings for the TeamA.Todo application in production environments.

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for sensitive configuration to enhance security. Configure the following environment variables on your Windows Server:

### Required Environment Variables

#### JWT_SECRET
The secret key used for signing JWT tokens. This is critical for authentication security.

```powershell
# PowerShell (run as Administrator)
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("JWT_SECRET", "your-very-long-and-secure-secret-key-at-least-32-characters", "Machine")
```

**Requirements:**
- Must be at least 32 characters long
- Should contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Should be unique per environment (dev, staging, production)
- Never commit this value to source control

**Example secure secret generation:**
```powershell
# Generate a secure random string
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Web
[System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword(64, 16)
```

#### ADMIN_EMAIL (Optional)
The email address for the default admin account.

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ADMIN_EMAIL", "admin@yourdomain.com", "Machine")
```

#### ADMIN_PASSWORD (Optional)
The password for the default admin account. If not set, a secure password will be generated and displayed in the logs on first startup.

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ADMIN_PASSWORD", "YourSecureAdminPassword123!", "Machine")
```

**Note:** After setting the admin password, change it immediately after first login.

### Setting Environment Variables on Windows Server

1. **Using System Properties:**
   - Right-click "This PC" â†’ Properties
   - Click "Advanced system settings"
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System variables", click "New"
   - Add each variable with its value

2. **Using PowerShell (Recommended):**
   ```powershell
   # Run PowerShell as Administrator
   
   # Set JWT Secret
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("JWT_SECRET", "your-secret-here", "Machine")
   
   # Set Admin Email
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ADMIN_EMAIL", "admin@yourdomain.com", "Machine")
   
   # Set Admin Password (optional)
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ADMIN_PASSWORD", "YourSecurePassword123!", "Machine")
   
   # Verify the variables are set
   [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("JWT_SECRET", "Machine")
   [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("ADMIN_EMAIL", "Machine")
   ```

3. **Using IIS Configuration (for IIS deployments):**
   - Open IIS Manager
   - Select your site
   - Double-click "Configuration Editor"
   - Navigate to system.webServer/aspNetCore
   - Click on environmentVariables
   - Add your environment variables

## HTTPS Configuration

### Enable HTTPS in Production

1. **Obtain an SSL Certificate:**
   - Use Let's Encrypt for free certificates
   - Or purchase from a trusted Certificate Authority

2. **Configure in IIS:**
   - Import the certificate in IIS
   - Bind HTTPS to your site on port 443
   - Configure HTTP to HTTPS redirect

3. **Update appsettings.Production.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "Https": {
       "Port": 443
     },
     "Kestrel": {
       "Endpoints": {
         "Https": {
           "Url": "https://*:443",
           "Certificate": {
             "Path": "path/to/certificate.pfx",
             "Password": "certificate-password"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### HSTS Configuration

The application automatically enables HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in production with:
- 365-day max age
- Include subdomains
- Preload enabled

## Rate Limiting

The application implements several rate limiting policies:

1. **Global Rate Limit:**
   - 100 requests per minute per IP/user

2. **Authentication Endpoints:**
   - Login: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
   - Registration: 3 attempts per 24 hours
   - Password Reset: 3 attempts per hour

3. **API Endpoints:**
   - Authenticated users: 200 requests per minute
   - Unauthenticated users: 50 requests per minute

## Security Headers

The application automatically adds the following security headers:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## First-Time Setup Checklist

1. [ ] Set JWT_SECRET environment variable
2. [ ] Set ADMIN_EMAIL environment variable (optional)
3. [ ] Set ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable (optional)
4. [ ] Configure SSL certificate
5. [ ] Enable HTTPS binding in IIS
6. [ ] Configure firewall rules
7. [ ] Start the application
8. [ ] Check logs for generated admin password (if not set)
9. [ ] Login with admin credentials
10. [ ] Change admin password immediately
11. [ ] Configure CORS origins in appsettings.Production.json
12. [ ] Test rate limiting is working

## Monitoring Security

1. **Check Application Logs:**
   - Located in `Logs/` directory
   - Monitor for failed authentication attempts
   - Check for rate limiting violations

2. **Review User Activity:**
   - Use the admin panel to review user activities
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns

3. **Regular Security Updates:**
   - Keep .NET runtime updated
   - Update NuGet packages regularly
   - Review and update security configurations

## Troubleshooting

### JWT Secret Not Found
If you see "JWT Secret is not configured" error:
1. Verify environment variable is set correctly
2. Restart IIS/application pool
3. Check if running under correct user context

### Rate Limiting Too Restrictive
Adjust limits in `ApiExtensions.cs` if needed for your use case.

### HTTPS Redirect Not Working
1. Ensure HTTPS binding is configured in IIS
2. Check firewall allows port 443
3. Verify certificate is valid

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets to source control**
2. **Use strong, unique passwords**
3. **Enable two-factor authentication for admin accounts**
4. **Regularly rotate JWT secrets**
5. **Monitor logs for security events**
6. **Keep all dependencies updated**
7. **Use least privilege principle for database connections**
8. **Regular security audits**

## Emergency Procedures

### Compromised JWT Secret
1. Generate new JWT secret immediately
2. Update environment variable
3. Restart application
4. All users will need to re-authenticate

### Suspected Breach
1. Review activity logs
2. Disable compromised accounts
3. Reset all admin passwords
4. Review and rotate all secrets
5. Notify affected users if necessary
